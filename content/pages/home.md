about: "We create site-specific hybrid performances, exploring the meeting points
  between object and physical theatre. We ask whether delving into life-in-miniature
  can uncover the extraordinary in the everyday. We like to explore the dark side
  and the pink side, aiming to look into the impact of visual poetry on audiences
  through engaging artistic experimentation. \n\nWe are a group of four interdisciplinary
  performance artists, based in Germany, the UK, and Iceland, who create performances
  blending the landscapes of the virtual and the real, alongside questioning the role
  of the self in contemporary society. We aim to create visceral experiences outside
  of conventional theatre settings in connection with transnational collaborations. "
